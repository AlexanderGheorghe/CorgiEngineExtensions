This is a script which helps with the parallax scripts of corgi engine or any other. It's for saving the current sprite positions in the scene.

Place ArtTransformShortcut on the main gameobject which contains all of your art. For metroidvanias, if  you have multiple rooms set up under one gameobject, place the script at that gameobject.

Then, for each art game object whose transform details you want to save, add an ArtTransformSaver

Then, from the ArtTransformShortcut, you can get all ArtTransformSavers, and from there, you can save all transforms of all objects that have the ArtTransformSaver script.
